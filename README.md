## How It Works üîç

### Speech Recognition
The app uses the browser's built-in Web Speech API which supports Bengali language (bn-IN). This means:
- No external speech recognition API needed
- No signup or registration required
- Zero cost for speech recognition
- Works completely in the browser

### Translation
The app uses a client-side approach to connect directly to Google Translate:
- No Google Cloud account or API key required
- Free translation from Bengali to English
- Works directly in the browser
- No server setup needed

Note: The translation feature has usage limits. If you need high-volume translation, consider integrating with an official API.

## Browser Compatibility üåê

The Web Speech API is supported in:
- Google Chrome (desktop and Android)
- Microsoft Edge
- Safari (desktop and iOS)

Firefox and some other browsers may not support speech recognition features.
