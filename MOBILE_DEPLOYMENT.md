# Mobile Deployment Guide for Bengali Voice Order App

This guide provides instructions specifically for mobile deployment and optimization of the Bengali Voice Order app.

## Mobile-Specific Optimizations

This app has been optimized for mobile devices with:

1. **Touch-friendly UI**: Larger buttons, appropriate spacing, and touch-friendly controls
2. **Responsive layout**: Adjusts layout based on screen size
3. **PWA support**: Installable on mobile home screens
4. **Offline capability**: Service worker caching for offline use

## Icon Requirements

For proper mobile display, you should replace the placeholder icons with real icons:

- `public/icon-192x192.png` (192×192px)
- `public/icon-512x512.png` (512×512px)
- `public/maskable-icon.png` (512×512px with safe zone for adaptive icons)
- `public/record-icon.png` (96×96px for shortcuts)

The `public/icon-placeholder.html` file provides a template for creating these icons.

## Splash Screens

For a better mobile experience, create splash screen images using the template in `public/splash.html`:

1. Open the template in a browser
2. Take screenshots or export as images
3. Add code in `index.html` to display splash screens for iOS and Android

### iOS Splash Screen Example

```html
<!-- Add to index.html head section -->
<link rel="apple-touch-startup-image" href="public/splash-iphone.png" media="(device-width: 375px) and (device-height: 812px) and (-webkit-device-pixel-ratio: 3)">
```
